The Contest winners will be chosen by a pre-selected group of judges who will evaluate each eligible Moscow Mule recipe submission by using a number of criteria; creativity and originality of ingredients (other than vodka and ginger) and recipe, taste appeal and balance, and how well the recipe represents the selected region.  Five (5) winners will be selected and each will win one (1) of five (5) grand prizes.  Depending on the volume of entries, Administrator and Sponsor will make every good faith effort to try and award the five grand prizes based on geography.  There will be one (1) winner from the West region, one (1) winner from the South Central region, one (1) winner from the South Atlantic region, one (1) winner from the Midwest region and one (1) winner from the Northeast region (“Winner”, “Grand Prize Winner” or collectively “Winners”, “Grand Prize Winners”).
