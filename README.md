#Moscow Mule Challenge

I paired with another designer/developer to create this contest page for Smirnoff and Shiftgig in 2014. We were supported by content and direction from the Shiftgig marketing team as well. The page was built with Bootstrap 3, jQuery, and php backend. I primarily contributed on page structure, jQuery, some of the styling, and most of the php.

Unfortunately this archived version of the site has been stripped of much of it's php, since it no longer has a database to connect to. The form no longer submits as a result.
